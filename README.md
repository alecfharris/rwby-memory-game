# RWBY Memory Game

## Description
RWBY Memory Game is a simple memory game with a responsive design built using React and inspired by RWBY. The goal is to click all the unique tiles without clicking on a tile that has already been clicked before. Once a tile has been clicked, the tiles shuffle to make the game more difficult. If a tile is clicked twice, the game resets and all previously clicked tiles are once again available to be clicked. Try and see if you can click 12 in a row!
